# Hackjam JHipster

Hello everyone ! 

Hereby you will find a broken Angular + Spring Boot application. 
The goal of this evening is to fix this application and learn about more about jHipster and 
what it can bring to your everyday projects.

At its core, jHipster is just a Yeoman generator that can scaffold web applications using Spring Boot for the backend 
and Angular/React for the frontend. Where JHipster starts to become interesting is that it gives us 
application that are already shipped with multiple functionalities that are in general mandatory in most apps such 
as a database, logging, security, and others such as internationalization ...

Also, let's not forget that JHipster already makes it very easy for us to push the app into production as it gives us 
things like Docker support as standard, logging, caching and other tools that 
already make the link to cloud providers so we can push it easier to the cloud. 

In the HackJam you will learn about :

- Spring Boot 
- Spring Security 
- Angular 
- JHipster and its possibilities 

We hope you'll have fun, enjoy !

# TODO

- In the current state the app has multiple bugs on the frontend and the backend.  
Fix the bugs and make the app work, don't forget to launch the app separetely with `./gradlew` and `npm start` so you can see the errors in realtime.
- The next step would be to make the `Become a patient` feature work and fix all bugs. 
- Update the patient entity to add a new field called  patientNumber. This string is autogenerated so when we want to become a patient, we get back this number. This patientNumber will used to identify the patient
- After that you can start the `Create an appointment` feature. 
By leveraging the capabilities of jHipster you should be able to implement this functionality quite quickly
    - Add a new entity called `Appointment` 
        - An `Appointment` has: a requestDate, a patientNumber, a confirmed(boolean) and a reason.
        - An `Appointment` is not confirmed by default.
        - A `Patient` can have several appointments and an `Appointment` is linked to one user only.
    - When a user wants to create an `Appointment` he has to provide: a requestDate, patientNumber, a reason :
        - When saving we should put the confirmed status at false.
    - And lastly create a new role for the patient :
        - The patient should be able to see the `Appointments` they created.
    
    
If you have any further question don't hesitate to ask the mentors as they'll gladly answer your questions. 


## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    npm install

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./gradlew
    npm start

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### Service workers

Service workers are commented by default, to enable them please uncomment the following code.

* The service worker registering script in index.html

```html
<script>
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        navigator.serviceWorker
        .register('./service-worker.js')
        .then(function() { console.log('Service Worker Registered'); });
    }
</script>
```

Note: workbox creates the respective service worker and dynamically generate the `service-worker.js`

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    npm install --save --save-exact leaflet

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

    npm install --save-dev --save-exact @types/leaflet

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
Edit [src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts](src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts) file:
~~~
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
~~~

Edit [src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css](src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css) file:
~~~
@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
~~~
Note: there are still few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

### Using angular-cli

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

    ng generate component my-component

will generate few files:

    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
    update src/main/webapp/app/app.module.ts


## Building for production

To optimize the hackjamJhipster application for production, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootWar

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./gradlew test

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    npm test



For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean test sonarqube
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./gradlew bootWar -Pprod buildDocker

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
